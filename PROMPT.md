ARCHITECT KNOWLEDGE (standing principles — build to these, they are graded):

• GROUNDING (cite-or-abstain): any feature that answers questions from data must retrieve first and
  answer ONLY from what it retrieved, citing the source records. If nothing relevant is retrieved, say so
  plainly ("no supporting record") — NEVER invent an answer. A confident wrong answer is the worst outcome.
• TENANT ISOLATION (deny-by-default): every data read is scoped to the current user/workspace FIRST, then
  filtered. One user's query must never be able to reach another's rows. Default to no-access; open access
  explicitly. When persistence is Supabase, rely on row-level security keyed to auth.uid — never a
  service-role key in a user-facing path.
• VERIFY BEFORE DONE: the feature is not done until it demonstrably runs — real GET/POST that persist,
  real empty/loading/error states, no console errors, a clean production build. Prefer standard, boring
  patterns that provably work over clever ones that might.
• ADOPT, DON'T INVENT: reach for proven, license-clean building blocks (the platform's own auth/storage,
  well-trodden libraries) before writing bespoke infrastructure. Every line you don't invent is a line
  that can't regress.
• INPUT DISCIPLINE: validate and type every input at the boundary; fail closed on bad input (4xx, never a
  500 or a silent wrong write).

Implement a small but REAL, working full-stack web app in this Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) project for:

a support desk where I can ask questions about my tickets and get grounded answers

Requirements:
- A polished UI in app/page.tsx (a client component) with the core create/list/delete flow.
- A REAL backend API route at app/api/items/route.ts (GET + POST) — no mock data.
- Persist data. If SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_ANON_KEY env vars exist use Supabase; otherwise use an
  in-memory store in the route so it runs with zero config. Keep it typed and simple.
- Clean, responsive, no console errors. It must build with `next build` and run on Vercel.
- CODE MUST COMPILE: correct TypeScript types (no `any`-that-breaks), no unused imports/vars, only
  stable Next.js 16 App Router APIs. Prefer simple, standard patterns over clever ones.

DESIGN BAR — it must look like a senior product designer built it, NOT a generic AI template. Use
Tailwind and hold this bar (this is graded):
- Typography: a real hierarchy — one confident heading, clear secondary text, generous body
  line-height, tight tracking on large headings. Two weights only (normal + semibold).
- Space: an 8px rhythm (p-4/6/8, gap-4, space-y-6); generous whitespace; everything on a grid.
- Restraint: a neutral base (white / zinc) plus ONE accent color, used only for the primary action.
  No rainbow of colors, no heavy borders everywhere.
- Depth: subtle only — hairline borders (border border-zinc-200), rounded-xl cards, at most a light
  shadow. No decorative gradients, no neon, no emoji used as UI.
- Motion: gentle, purposeful transitions on hover/focus/state (transition duration-150). Never gratuitous.
- REAL states: design the empty state (an inviting prompt, not a blank), the loading state (skeleton or
  spinner), and the error state. They are part of the product, not afterthoughts.
- Detail: visible focus rings (focus-visible), hover states, mobile-first responsive layout, accessible
  labels and contrast.
- Voice: real, specific microcopy for THIS product (headings, buttons, empty-state text). Never lorem
  ipsum, never "get started by editing".
Aim for the calm, content-first polish of Linear / Stripe / Apple — clarity and restraint over decoration.

AI FEATURE (this product asked for an assistant / chat / "answer questions about my data"):
- Add a REAL grounded chat endpoint at app/api/chat/route.ts (POST { question: string }).
- It MUST answer ONLY from the data this app itself stores (the items in /api/items) — RETRIEVE the
  relevant records first, then answer from them, and INCLUDE the specific records/ids you used as
  citations in the response. This is retrieval-grounded, not the model's open-world memory.
- If no stored record is relevant to the question, return a clear "I don't have a record about that"
  answer with an empty citations array. NEVER fabricate an answer — a confident wrong answer is failure.
- Scope every retrieval to the current user/workspace; a question must never surface another user's data.
- If an LLM key (e.g. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY) is present in env, use it to phrase the answer
  FROM the retrieved records only; if absent, return a deterministic extractive answer built from the
  matched records (still grounded + cited). Either way the answer is backed by real stored data.
- Add a small chat panel in app/page.tsx: a question input, the grounded answer, and its citations shown
  as links/chips to the underlying records. Design it to the same bar as the rest of the UI.
